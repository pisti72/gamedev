FONT LICENSE Information:

Typeface: "Kelvinized" (Regular/Normal) Copyright © 2009

Format and Usage: Digital media, print, derivative use.

	[Kelvinized.ttf]

Description:	"Kelvinized" is a "retro" stylized font loosely based on the logo of the old Kelvinator® refrigeration line from years past.

		Kelvinized has a nice 1950's retro-industrial feel and has been used for many corporate logos as well as being
		integrated within various media including television and print.

		Kelvinized is unique as it was designed using a "typeface anatomy kit" which are a set of rules, including feature notations,
		angles, measurments, template, styling suggestions and other nuances derived from the shared apparent design-language elements
		of a finite number of existing characters that make up an existing logo, for instance.
		The kit is then used for the creation of any other character whose likeness implies that of the original logo typeface,
		also providing a more 'perfected' and consistent version of each original character. The additional new characters are then
		difficult to determine as never-have-been created along side the originals.
		This is similar to the way 'fake' human faces can be created using biometrics data from just a few sample individuals.
		The characters shared by, and implied from the original Kelvinator® logo have not been copied by any mechanical or digital
		means, but were recreated 'blindly' via the rule-set so character (likeness) must be considered a parody and not a derivative.
		This is a 'grey area' of course, so the end-user should at least refrain from reproducing and publishing the original logo
		or creating logos that have a stiking similarity to Kelvinator® or within their industry as competition.

Licensing FAQ:


What is a font license?

A Font License is simply an agreement that gives you permission to use a font, according to the terms of that agreement.
This is often called an End User License Agreement or "EULA".  By downloading and installing the provided font file, you agree to abide by the agreement.


Are fonts intellectual property?

Yes. Just like any artwork, music, or literary works, fonts are designed by actual people and are protected by certain intellectual property rights (copyright).
Beyond the design of the typeface itself, fonts are software, engineered with features and flexibility that enable good design and usability.


Do I need separate licenses for different uses or different instances of use?

Yes. There are a few basic license Fee Tier levels offered by K4ICY (Fonts by Majik Mike), each pertaining to a different form of usage.
All users can freely download and install the font on any of their devices and they are allowed to freely distribute those files.
Hobbyists, students, small organizations and small local entrepreneurs should be able to enjoy the font without worry of compensation,
they can alter the face for whatever creations or artworks and distribute the font to their friends, family and colleagues.
Larger businesses, corporations, advertising firms and media companies should consider the higher tier fee levels and correspond with the author for legals.


The Font is Free to download and thousands have used it without paying, surely I can do the same...

Sure. The author appreciates proliferation of its fonts, but is also a struggling designer with mouths to feed.
The author will be fair but please so consider at least a donation, if not a fee.
A warning to larger entities disregarding the Fee Tier: The author perfectly understands the ambiguity and ill-conceived decisions made
by designers at 3rd-party advertising agencies, but ultimately, the responsibility lies with the end-user.
